# JGrasp-Projects
These are small projects that I had to do in one of my java classes! It was challenging and a good learning process for me! It's nothing too
crazy or fancy, but it helped me learn code in a universal way. 

# Hello World
Of course, a fun way to start with some language I never used before is printing out a "Hello World" to it. Nothing special...

# IsEven
This one gives you an option to enter an integer and says whether the answer you put is either an even number or an odd number. I made a 
boolean method that checks if the number is equal to an even number. How I did this is by using the input that you made and used the % sign
by 2 to yield any remainders. If the remainder is equal to 0, then it returns true, making it even. If not, then it returns false, making it odd. 
However, I also made it so that it can also check if it's an actual integer and not a letter. If it is a letter, then the program terminates itself. I also 
did this with negative integers.
