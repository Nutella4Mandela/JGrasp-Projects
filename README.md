# JGrasp-Projects
These are small projects that I had to do in one of my java classes! It was challenging and a good learning process for me! It's nothing too
crazy or fancy, but it helped me learn code in a universal way. 

# Hello World
Of course, a fun way to start with some language I never used before is printing out a "Hello World" to it. Nothing special...
