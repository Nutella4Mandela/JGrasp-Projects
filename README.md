# JGrasp-Projects
These are small projects that I had to do in one of my java classes! It was challenging and a good learning process for me! It's nothing too
crazy or fancy, but it helped me learn code in a universal way. 

# Hello World
Of course, a fun way to start with some language I never used before is printing out a "Hello World" to it. Nothing special...

# IsEven
This one gives you an option to enter an integer and says whether the answer you put is either an even number or an odd number. I made a 
boolean method that checks if the number is equal to an even number. How I did this is by using the input that you made and used the % sign
by 2 to yield any remainders. If the remainder is equal to 0, then it returns true, making it even. If not, then it returns false, making it odd. 
However, I also made it so that it can also check if it's an actual integer and not a letter. If it is a letter, then the program terminates itself. I also 
did this with negative integers.

# Speed
This project calculates the average speed depending on the distance and time using miles and hours respectively. I've used the JOptionPane for
this one to make it look a little nicer. I gave the user two questions: How many miles have you driven and How many hours did it take to get to
your destination? I then calculated the result by using your distance and dividing it by your time, getting your average speed. In this case, I
drove 6 miles in 5 hours(that is really slow), giving me an average speed of 1.2. It then prompts you to try again or not. If you don't want to try 
again, the program terminates itself, but if you do, it goes back to the first question.

# Temperature
This project converts preset temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius in a table. It's a pretty simple project where I was trying to understand how
to use for loops properly. Of course, I used a formula that calculates Celsius from -20F to 220F. Every time it's done with one of them, the 
fahrenheit goes up by 10. I used a for loop for all of it. Nothing groundbreaking, of course, but I did well with what I had.
